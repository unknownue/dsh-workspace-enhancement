/**
 * REQ-I9 (ADR-0022 D1): the machine-list fence badge projection, in its own
 * `.ts` module for the same reason `route-id.ts` exists — the sandbox test
 * runner uses Node's built-in type stripping and cannot load `.tsx`, not even
 * transitively, so a helper that lived in `row-badges.ts` (which imports
 * `status.tsx` for its view type) would be invisible to `npm run test:agent`.
 * `row-badges.ts` re-exports it, so the badge surface keeps ONE implementation.
 *
 * Zero migration is the whole contract here: `'off'` — the default, and every
 * machine record that predates the field — renders the EMPTY string, so an
 * upgraded settings page shows exactly what it showed before.
 *
 * @module dsh-workspace-enhancement/client/sandbox-badge
