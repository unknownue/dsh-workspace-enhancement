 * The client-side spelling of the host's route-placeholder rule: recover the

 *
 * WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE (t4): two client consumers need the same rule — the
 * DOM row-badge layer (`./row-badges.ts`, which looks the id up on workspace
 * paths) and the official-slot remote-status entry (`./remote-status.ts`, which
 * looks it up on a session cwd). `row-badges.ts` imports `status.tsx` for its
 * palette, and the sandbox test runner cannot load `.tsx` (not even
 * transitively — `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`), so a pure-`.ts` home is what
 * lets the entry's judgment be unit-tested by `npm run test:agent`. The body
 * below is the function `row-badges.ts` used to define; it re-exports it
 * unchanged, so that layer behaves exactly as before.
