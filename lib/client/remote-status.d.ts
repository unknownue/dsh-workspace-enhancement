/**
 * Remote-status header entry — pure logic (REQ-I2 entry point, official-slot
 * route).
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN MODULE (docs/testing.md): the sandbox runner (`test:agent`) never
 * executes `.tsx`, so every judgment the entry makes lives here — the slot and
 * entry identity, the session→connection resolution, the render decision, and
 * the registration options. The `.tsx` beside it only renders.
 *
 * TRUTH SOURCE: a session is remote when its cwd routes to a machine — the very
 * fact the host reads for the remote prompt sections
 * (`src/session-remote-context.ts` → `remoteRouteFromCwd`). The client must not
 * import that module (it drags `node:fs` / `ssh2` into the browser bundle), so
 * the route-id rule is mirrored here through `routeIdOf` of `./route-id.ts`,
 * the single client-side spelling of it, shared with the DOM badge layer.
 *
 * SLOT CHOICE (ADR-0017 + the round's hard constraint): the entry registers
 * into `conversation.session.header.utilities` — the official additive list
 * slot both peer families declare ("Right-aligned Session utilities in ascending
 * order"; the rc.1 catalog lists it with the `session-log-download` occupant, the
 * rc.2 catalog with `open-in-app` + `session-log-download`), so the feature is
 * visible both on the family the live deployment runs and on rc.2. A
 * right-aligned utilities cell is where a remote STATUS belongs: the sibling
 * `conversation.session.header.actions` is the title-adjacent ACTION group,
 * where this plugin already owns the side-workspaces cell.
 *
 * No conditional double registration, ever: `ctx.slots.inject` waits for a
 * declaration and cannot ask whether a key exists, so registering into two
 * seats would render the same status twice on rc.2. Should a live check ever
 * show the utilities seat absent, the fallback is to move this ONE constant to
 * `conversation.session.header.actions` — never to register in both.
 * @module dsh-workspace-enhancement/client/remote-status
