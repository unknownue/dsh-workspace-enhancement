/**
 * Session workspace cockpit — pure derivation logic (REQ-I11 / ADR-0021 §2.9).
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN MODULE (docs/testing.md): the sandbox runner (`npm run test:agent`)
 * never executes `.tsx`, so every judgment the cockpit makes lives here — which
 * sections exist, where the session actually works, which toggle is on, and how
 * a stale machine id is handled. `./side-workspaces.tsx` only renders what these
 * functions return.
 *
 * TRUTH SOURCES, in order:
 *
 *  - the session cwd (read by the panel through the `remoteFacts` seat over the
 *    sessions store — the same fact `./remote-status.ts` reads) says WHERE the
 *    session works: any accepted route spelling (`ssh://<id>/<path>`, the
 *    `dsw-routes/<id>/…` placeholder tree the host's `session.route` hands back,
 *    the legacy `dsh-ssh-routes/` tree) is the remote main workspace; anything
 *    else is a plain local session (ADR-0021 §2.9 item 1);
 *  - `machines.list` is the machine universe: a connection row exists for every
 *    registry machine and for nothing else;
 *  - `session.conn.list` is the ONLY source of the connected set. This module
 *    keeps no second copy: the panel re-reads it after every mutation and derives
 *    the toggle state from whatever that read returned, so a failed toggle can
 *    never leave the UI optimistically wrong (ADR-0021 §0/§2.9: the panel toggle
 *    and `sw_connect` write one store, and the UI may not disagree with it).
 *
 * THE IMPLICIT MAIN MACHINE (ADR-0021 §2.4; host side `connectedMachinesOf` in
 * `src/exec-tools.ts`): a cwd that routes to a machine the registry still knows
 * counts as CONNECTED without being stored. The panel performs the same union
 * the `sw_exec` gate performs, so what the UI shows as connected is exactly what
 * the tool accepts. The row is flagged `implicit` and is not toggleable, because
 * disconnecting it cannot stick: the connection comes from the session's own cwd,
 * not from the store. (A cwd routing to a machine the registry no longer knows is
 * still shown as the main workspace — that is where the session works — but it is
 * NOT counted as connected, again mirroring the host.)
 *
 * STALE IDS: a connected id the registry no longer knows (a stale `machines.list`)
 * is reported as `staleConnectionIds` and renders NO row. The panel must never
 * offer a toggle for a machine that does not exist, and `side.conn.empty` is about
 * machines the user can actually see.
