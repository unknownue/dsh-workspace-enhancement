/**
 * Execution-world transport shared by the SSH subprocess and filesystem
 * providers. The aggregate `ctx.ssh` service is the default transport; an
 * `ssh://<connectionId>/<path>` working directory routes one operation to a
 * registry-owned connection instead, so sessions created from the web
 * connection manager execute on the host they were opened against.
 *
 * The web client cannot pass an `ssh://` cwd to `sessions.create` — the host's
 * session service unconditionally `mkdir`s the project directory through
 * `node:fs`. So each remote route also has a LOCAL placeholder directory
 * (`<dsh home>/dsw-routes/<id>/<remote path>`; the pre-rename
 * `dsh-ssh-routes/` tree keeps routing for live sessions) that the client
 * registers and hands to `sessions.create`; both spellings route to the same
 * registry connection here.
