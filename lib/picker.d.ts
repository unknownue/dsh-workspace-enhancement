/**
 * Directory-picker browse backend over the dsh-workspace-enhancement SSH
 * connection: the web GUI's "Select Workspace Directory" dialog — the
 * add-workspace flow — browses the remote host through the shared SFTP
 * channel, and picked remote paths become workspace paths the plugin's
 * providers already understand.
 *
 * Behavior facts:
 * - On a Windows host the picker is dual-root: local listings keep the
 *   drive-qualified paths of the host account (so the existing local browsing
 *   is unchanged), the remote host appears as one pinned entry on the local
 *   home level, and every POSIX-absolute path addresses the remote host —
 *   the same routing rule as {@link SshRuntime.resolveRemoteCwd}.
 * - On a POSIX host every absolute path addresses the remote host, so the
 *   picker is remote-only (the local filesystem is unreachable through it;
 *   it would share the remote path vocabulary).
 * - Remote listings return directories only, name-sorted, symlinks to
 *   directories followed, `hidden` means dot-prefixed, and one level is
 *   bounded at `maxEntries` rows with `truncated` flagging a cut. The remote
 *   level walk is shared with the `/dsw` browse channel
 *   ({@link module:dsh-workspace-enhancement/listing}).
 * - `createDirectory` is non-recursive SFTP mkdir with an existence probe.
 *
 * Mount as its own row (`dsh-workspace-enhancement/picker`): the
 * directory-picker seam registers one implementation per context, so this row
 * must REPLACE the deployment's existing `directory-picker` row (the web
 * bundle's `@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-directory-picker-auto`), not sit beside it,
 * and the shipped in-app browser surface
 * (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-directory-picker-browse`) must be composed
 * separately because replacing `-auto` drops the surface it mounted.
 * @module dsh-workspace-enhancement/picker
