/**
 * The SSH execution half of the subprocess capability (no service
 * registration): routes every call over the registry connection named by the
 * working directory.
 *
 * AUDIT-6 (ADR-0020): when a `gate` is supplied, every remote spawn passes it
 * BEFORE any SSH activity. `spawn` keeps its synchronous seam contract — the
 * question rides the handle's async startup (`SshSubprocessHandle` preflight)
 * — while `spawnTerminal` (async signature) awaits the gate up front. The gate
 * itself no-ops for machines without `remoteApproval` (default `'off'`), for
 * non-shell-shaped host-assembled argv, and for routes without a registry
 * machine (the aggregate `ctx.ssh` transport) — see ADR-0020 D1's honest
 * non-coverage list. Temporary (`sw_connect save:false`) ids no longer exist
 * (ADR-0021 §1/§5).
 *
 * REQ-I9 (ADR-0022): a second optional dep, the remote sandbox `fence`, rides
 * the SAME async startup as a later stage. `spawn` hands it to the handle as
 * `resolveArgv` while `runGate` keeps the **unwrapped** argv — the approval card
 * must preview the command the user actually wrote (ADR-0022 §2.2). A fence
 * that cannot prove the remote runner is usable throws, and the command is
 * never serialized, let alone sent (fail closed).
 *
 * The fence (and its terminal guard) is never ABSENT: when no dep is passed —
 * a bare subpath-row mount, `dsh-workspace-enhancement/subprocess`, which is a
 * documented first-class mount style — the engine resolves a context-derived
 * one lazily (`sandboxFence`). Every composition is therefore fenced, and an
 * explicitly passed dep still wins (no double-wrap on the aggregate path).
