/**
 * REQ-I9 / ADR-0022: the remote sandbox fence — WIRING half.
 *
 * {@link module:dsh-workspace-enhancement/remote-sandbox} owns the pure decision
 * surface (the bwrap profile vector, the probe command, the probe parser, the
 * verdict cache, the refusal vocabulary). This module owns what that pure half
 * deliberately left out: the **live** closure the subprocess seam awaits per
 * spawn, built from `ctx` exactly like the AUDIT-6 gate
 * ({@link module:dsh-workspace-enhancement/remote-approval-gate}):
 *
 *  1. resolve the per-machine mode through the registry's secret-free views;
 *  2. `'off'` — and every machine record that predates the field — returns the
 *     argv **by identity**, with zero probes (ADR-0022 §2.1, I9-7);
 *  3. `'read-only'` / `'workspace-write'` require a **positive** proof that the
 *     remote runner is usable *for this connection* — the functional probe of
 *     `buildRemoteProbeCommand` over the transport's control channel;
 *  4. only then is the argv handed to `remoteRunnerArgv`.
 *
 * ## Fail-closed is the whole point (ADR-0022 §2.3)
 *
 * There is no fallback path in this file. A failed probe, an unknown machine, a
 * `workspace-write` request without a usable absolute remote workspace root, or
 * a broken registry lookup all **throw** a `SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE` error before
 * any user command text reaches SSH. It never runs the unwrapped argv and never
 * degrades to `read-only` on its own. That is the strongest acceptance
 * assertion of the REQ-I9 suite (I9-5: prove the command never executed).
 *
 * ## Where this sits relative to the approval gate (ADR-0022 §2.2)
 *
 * The gate and the fence are two different questions asked at two different
 * stages of spawn: the gate ("may this run?") sees the **unwrapped** argv
 * first; the fence then either (REQ-I5) ensures a core session is alive and
 * returns the same argv, or (legacy tests without a hub) wraps it as
 * `bwrap … -- argv`. Wrapping earlier would make `bwrap` the gate's `argv[0]`.
 *
 * ## Honest boundaries after REQ-I5
 *
 * With a live core hub, fenced machines confine **spawn and file tools** in
 * the same jail. Interactive terminals are still refused (ADR-0022 §2.4).
 * `remoteSandbox: off` keeps today's SFTP + bare exec.
