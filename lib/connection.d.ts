/**
 * One standalone SSH connection owned by the connection registry (not the
 * `ctx.ssh` service): the same ProxyJump chain, auth, SFTP, and exec mechanics
 * as `SshRuntime`, but bound to a registry entry instead of the shared
 * service. The registry uses it for connection tests and per-connection
 * directory browsing; the `ssh://<id>/<path>` cwd routing in the providers
 * rides the same instances.
 *
 * The shared session state lives in {@link module:dsh-workspace-enhancement/ssh-core};
 * this module only resolves a registry spec into the hop chain and wires the
 * per-connection error messages. Host-key policy resolution order:
 * `spec.hostKeyMode` (TOFU) → `spec.strictHostKeyChecking`/`spec.knownHosts`
 * (legacy manual) → the registry-wide default mode (TOFU `accept-new`).
