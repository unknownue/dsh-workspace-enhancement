/**
 * REQ-I9 / ADR-0022: the remote sandbox fence — pure logic half.
 *
 * A per-machine axis `remoteSandbox: 'off' | 'read-only' | 'workspace-write'`
 * (default `'off'` ⇒ zero migration) asks the mixed subprocess seam's remote
 * branch to wrap every spawned command as
 * `<runner> <bwrap profile args> -- <original argv>` before it is serialised
 * into the single SSH exec string. This module owns the whole *decision* and
 * *shape* surface of that wrap; the wiring (the `resolveArgv` startup stage of
 * `SshSubprocessHandle`, the registry field, the settings form) lives in the
 * other halves and is deliberately absent here, so everything below is
 * unit-testable without a host — the same split AUDIT-6 uses (ADR-0014, and
 * see {@link module:dsh-workspace-enhancement/remote-approval-gate}).
 *
 * ## Provenance of the profile vector (this is the drift risk)
 *
 * The tokens below are a LOCAL RE-DERIVATION of `bwrapProfileArgs(policy)` from
 * the deployed upstream provider `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-local` (read on
 * 2026-09-13 from `…/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-local/lib/
 * index.js`, bundle region `lib/types/profiles.js`, version `0.1.5-rc.2`; see
 * `.tmp/recon/A3-remote-runner.md` §Q1(c)). It cannot be imported:
 *
 *  - `bwrapProfileArgs` is **not exported** (the package's `exports` map has
 *    only `.`, `./src/*` and `./package.json`), and
 *  - `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-local` is **not a dependency of this repo** and
 *    has no `package-lock.json` entry — adding one would desynchronise `npm ci`
 *    (the same hazard recorded for `dsh-user-approval` in the R22 report).
 *
 * The re-derivation is pinned by `test/remote-sandbox-drift.test.ts`, which
 * reads that deployed file when it exists on the machine and asserts the token
 * arrays match; on a machine without it (CI) that test reports SKIP instead of
 * failing. Upstream changing the profile is therefore a visible red on the
 * machine that has the package, never a silent divergence.
 *
 * ## Fail-closed rules encoded here (ADR-0022 §2.3)
 *
 * The fence's failure mode is "refuse", never "run it anyway":
 *
 *  - a mode other than `'off'` without a *positive* probe verdict must be
 *    refused by the wiring ({@link REMOTE_SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE}, and
 *    {@link REMOTE_SANDBOX_MESSAGES} carries the texts);
 *  - `workspace-write` without a usable absolute remote workspace root throws
 *    here, at argv-construction time, rather than degrading to `read-only`
 *    (a silent downgrade would be a lie: the user asked for a writable
 *    workspace and would get a command that cannot write);
 *  - the probe is **functional** — {@link buildRemoteProbeCommand} runs the
 *    real `read-only` profile around `true` and requires exit 0. A missing
 *    remote `bwrap` reports `env: 'bwrap': No such file or directory` (exit
 *    127) — which does NOT match upstream's `RUNNER_FAILURE_RULES.bwrap`
 *    (`'bwrap: '`), so post-hoc stderr matching cannot carry the remote case
 *    and is **not** the mechanism (A3 §Q2 finding 1).
 *
 * ## Honest boundaries (ADR-0022 §2.7)
 *
 *  - **File tools share the core jail when fenced** (REQ-I5). `off` still uses
 *    host-side SFTP. Interactive terminals stay refused. This is reported
 *    truthfully by {@link remoteSandboxFactsOf}.
 *  - The profile is **file effects only**: no network namespace, no
 *    `--clearenv`, no `--chdir`, no syscall filtering, no process visibility
 *    outside the PID namespace.
 *  - {@link REMOTE_DENIAL_SIGNATURES} is an in-band STDERR dialect with no
 *    typed denial channel: **second-line evidence for reporting only, never
 *    enforcement.** Enforcement is the wrapped argv plus the probe.

 * Build the POSITIVE functional probe command (ADR-0022 §2.3, A3 §Q4).

 * exactly like the existing fixed probes (`uname -s`, `cmd /c ver`) — its text
 * is a plugin constant, which is the same carve-out ADR-0020 D1 grants those
 * probes; it is NOT routed through the sandboxed spawn seam.
 *
 * One login shell, four steps:
 *  1. `command -v '<runner>'` — is it resolvable at all (this answers the
 *     "installed" question only, which is explicitly NOT sufficient);
 *  2. `'<runner>' --version` — the version/health fact, tolerated to fail;
 *  3. `'<runner>' <read-only profile> -- true` — the functional check: the
 *     REAL profile around `true`, which is what upstream `defaultProbeBwrap`
 *     does. This is the step that separates "present" from "usable" (no
 *     unprivileged user namespaces, seccomp/AppArmor blocking
 *     `clone(CLONE_NEWUSER)`, a denied `--proc`, …). It must exit 0.
 *
 * Exit status is the LAST step's: a runnable runner that cannot confine exits
 * non-zero. Deliberately NOT done: redirecting that failure to stderr. sshd
 * folds stderr into the channel's extended-data stream but `ExecOutcome`
 * collects it separately from stdout, and a channel dropped mid-flight can
 * lose it — the exit code is the part that cannot be lost. The explanatory
 * text is present when it survives, and {@link parseRemoteProbe} says so when
 * it did not.
 *
 * Injection posture: the only caller-supplied value is `runnerPath`, and it is
 * quoted with the repo's POSIX quoting helper at every one of its three
 * occurrences — no interpolation path reaches the shell unquoted. The profile
 * and `command -v`/`--version`/`true` are fixed tokens. The `--` terminator
 * keeps the runner from reading `--ro-bind` as its own option.
 *
 * **The functional step quotes each argv WORD SEPARATELY, never the joined
 * vector.** Joining first and quoting the result hands the shell ONE word, so a
 * perfectly healthy host tries to exec a program literally named
 * `bwrap --ro-bind / / … -- true` and exits 127 — and because every non-zero
 * exit reads as "runner unusable", fail-closed turns that into a fence that
 * refuses every command on every host, forever. `test/remote-sandbox.test.ts`
 * tokenizes this step back into the runner argv precisely so the two cannot
 * drift apart again (self-reviewer catch, 2026-09-13).
 *
 * @param runnerPath - remote runner program; defaults to
 *   {@link DEFAULT_REMOTE_RUNNER_PATH}.
 * @returns one POSIX shell command string requiring exit 0 for a usable fence.
