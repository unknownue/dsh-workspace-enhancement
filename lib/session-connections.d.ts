/**
 * REQ-I11: per-session CONNECTED-MACHINE state — which registry machines a
 * session has switched on with `sw_connect` (or with a toggle in the session
 * workspace panel). The machine universe is the user's registry: this store
 * keeps only machine ID REFERENCES (never credentials, never connection
 * objects), so removing a machine from the registry cannot leak through here.
 *
 * Model (REQ-I11): the connected set is the session's coarse gate.
 *
 * - `sw_connect(machines: [...])` and the panel toggle write THIS store, so the
 *   model's control plane and the UI cannot disagree;
 * - a session with an empty set sees no `sw_exec` and no remote prompt note;
 * - a session whose header cwd routes to a machine treats that machine as
 *   connected implicitly (the caller unions it in — the store stays literal).
 *
 * It is a GATE, not a fence: the filesystem face routes any `ssh://<id>/…` path
 * at registry level (ADR-0021), so this store controls visibility and tool
 * exposure, not reachability.
 *
 * Storage mirrors {@link SessionSideWorkspaceStore}: one JSON file
 * (`<dsh home>/dsw-session-connections.json`) holding
 * `sessions: { <sessionId>: <machineId[]> }` in connection order. Unknown or
 * legacy fields are ignored on read; a corrupt file warns and reads empty
 * rather than failing the host.
 *
 * Validation errors are plain `dsw:` English here: both callers (the tool layer
 * and the `/dsw` channel) re-check the same conditions and own the localized
 * wording at their own boundary.
 * @module dsh-workspace-enhancement/session-connections
