 *   tree, and the legacy `dsh-ssh-routes/<id>/…` tree (a session created from
 *   the remote workspace flow carries one of these as its header cwd) — runs
 *   over the registry-owned SSH transport ({@link SshSubprocessEngine} /
 *   {@link SshFileSystemEngine}).
 * - local world — everything else, including an absent cwd — delegates to the
 *   LOCAL provider implementation re-imported from the seam packages
 *   (`LocalSubprocessRuntime`, `SandboxedFileSystem`).
 *
 * This is the R4-I2 engine-routing fix: the model-facing tools
 * (`tool-bash`/`tool-pwsh`/`tool-fs`) stay bound to `ctx.subprocess`/
 * `ctx.fs`/`ctx.shell` exactly as shipped, and the routing happens inside the
 * services, so a remote workspace session executes its commands and file
 * operations on the server while a local session keeps today's local
 * behavior (including the sandbox fences).
