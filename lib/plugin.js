/**
 * One-row aggregate plugin: mounts the shared SSH connection owner plus the
 * MIXED subprocess and filesystem providers — the single implementation of
 * `ctx.subprocess` / `ctx.fs`, routing every call by its working directory
 * (remote routes over SSH, everything else delegates to the local
 * implementations). The local provider rows are disabled by this bundle's
 * patch (cordis.patch.yml) so their service registrations cannot collide with
 * the mixed ones; the sandbox rows and the sandboxed shell executors
 * (`bash-sandbox`/`pwsh-sandbox`) stay enabled and consume the mixed
 * `ctx.subprocess`.
 *
 * REQ-I13: remote sessions keep the deployment `/permission` default. A
 * remote-cwd `confine` passthrough stops the local runner from wrapping
 * remote argv (ADR-0025). Per-call sandbox policy selects core `--sandbox`.
 *
 * `name: dsh-workspace-enhancement` in cordis.yml is equivalent to the three
 * subpath rows (`dsh-workspace-enhancement/ssh`, `dsh-workspace-enhancement/
 * subprocess`, `dsh-workspace-enhancement/fs`) — except that the mixed wiring
 * only happens on the aggregate row. Subpath rows keep the pure-SSH form for
 * deployments that compose providers individually.
 * @module dsh-workspace-enhancement/plugin
